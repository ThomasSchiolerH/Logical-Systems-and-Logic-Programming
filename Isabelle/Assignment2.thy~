proposition <[] \<then> (((p \<rightarrow> q) \<rightarrow> p) \<rightarrow> p) # []>
proof -
     from Imp_R have ?thesis if <
          ((p \<rightarrow> q) \<rightarrow> p) # []
          \<then>
          p # []
          >
          using that by force
      with Imp_L have ?thesis if <
          []
          \<then>
          (p \<rightarrow> q) # p # []
          > and <

          \<then>
          p # []
          >
          using that by force
      with Basic have ?thesis if <

          using that by force
      with Basic show ?thesis
          by force
